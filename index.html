  <p>55 to 65 days are needed from germination to harvest of the root.</p>
  <p>The usually deep purple roots of <b>beetroot</b> are eaten either grilled, boiled, or roasted as a cooked vegetable, cold as a salad after cooking and adding oil and vinegar, or raw and shredded, either alone or combined with any salad vegetable.</p>

    <p>In fact, Jim Halpert once said this about beets, “Fact, bears eat beets. Bears, beets, <cite>Battlestar Galactica”.</cite></p>
    <blockquote>I have some <em>weird</em> habits. For instance, <strong>I love beets.</strong> Show me a salad bar and I will clean them out of their beets.</blockquote>
